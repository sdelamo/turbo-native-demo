        This screen was presented as a modal based on the path configuration file. Submitting this form will redirect back to the home screen. The native app will receive that visit proposal and initiate a new visit.
    </p>

    <p>
        Notice that submitting the form will also cause it to dismiss the modal. That's handled by the demo app's router.
